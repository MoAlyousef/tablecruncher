## Testing Windows Builds

Windows builds are still experimental. If you're testing the app on Windows, please pay special attention to:
- Installation issues (e.g., antivirus warnings, permissions)
- Application startup problems
- Display or layout glitches
- File opening/saving quirks

Your feedback on the Windows version is particularly valuable — even small reports help!

## No Pull Requests Yet

At this time, we are **not accepting pull requests**. Before opening the project to external code contributions, we need to review and clarify the legal implications of open-sourcing the app, especially around licensing and dependency management.

You're still welcome to fork the project and experiment — and please report any issues you find!


Thanks again for your interest in Tablecruncher!
