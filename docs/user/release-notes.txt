1.4.0.0 (2020-04-22)
--------------------

This is primarily a bug fix update. If fixes a nasty bug when searching
(and replacing) with regular expressions. When there was a single quote
in the search expression, replacing did not work as expected, sometimes
replacing weird data. So please upgrade as soon as possible, if you're
using regular expressions.
There's one new feature, though. "File > Split CSV ..." allows you to
easily split a CSV file into multiple CSV files. If the initial file
has the header row activated, all split files also contain that header
row.

* Feature: Split a CSV file in multiple files
* Fixed: Search and Replace using Regular Expressions didn't work when
    there were single quotes in the search or replace pattern
* Fixed: The font size of the edited cell did not zoom according to
    the chosen text zoom level
* Fixed: The label text shown on the "Processing" window was not
    readable on dark themes


1.3.0.0 (2020-02-05)
--------------------

Version 1.3 introduces a feature that's been on the road map for a very
long time: Regular Expressions! You can now use ECMAScript 5 compatible
Regular Expressions in the Find&Replace dialog to find and replace
matching cells or flag rows. Please read the designated chapter in the
documentation on how Regular Expressions are implemented in
Tablecruncher and how to use them.
Flagged rows can now be easily exported as a new CSV file, using the
CSV definitions as set by the source file. Flagging status can now also
be inverted, so that formerly flagged rows are not flagged and vice
versa.
The new feature "Jump to Cell ..." allows you to directly navigate to
an arbitrary cell. Insted of just accepting a row number, you can now
enter a column name, prepended by a colon or combine both to jump to
the cell you want.

* Feature: Use Regular Expressions as a search pattern and back
	references in Find&Replace dialog
* Feature: Export flagged rows to a CSV file
* Feature: Invert flagged rows
* Feature: Jump to an arbitrary cell using row number and column name
	or number
* Feature: Keyboard shortcut to move columns
* Feature: New theme "Solarized Dark"
* Feature: Handle up to 10 files simultaneously
* Fixed: When closing Find&Replace or Sort window, wrong window was
	activated, if more thant one Tablecruncher window has been opened


1.2.0.1 (2019-10-10)
--------------------

This update offers functions to split a single column into two columns and to
merge two existing columns into one. This should be useful for a lot of
situations, where the data you get has not the expected format. Additionally
Tablecruncher now stores the column widths and the header row status when a
file is saved. On opening that same file again the widths and header row is set
to its previous state.

* Feature: Split column into two columns
* Feature: Merge two adjacent columns by providing an optional glue string
* Feature: Column widths and header status are stored when file gets save
* Feature: Asterisk can now be used as a delimiter
* Fixed: When new rows were created by pasting, the columns next to them
    sometimes won't accept new data

1.0.0.0 (2019-06-28)
--------------------

In version 1.0.0.0 memory usage could be reduced a lot. Tablecruncher can now
open and process even extremly large CSV files and most tasks are now faster
than before. On the other hand, there are some actions (sorting rows, and
moving, inserting and deleting columns) that will take longer.
